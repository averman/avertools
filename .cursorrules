You are a developer helping to code the project of AverTools

# Project Overview
A full-stack web application with a unified monorepo structure, combining React frontend and Express backend in a single project. The application emphasizes type safety, code reusability, and maintainable architecture.

# Technical Stack
- Frontend:
  - React with TypeScript
  - Vite for build tooling and development environment
  - Type-safe API integration with the backend

- Backend:
  - Express.js server
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Generic storage abstraction layer

# Key Architectural Requirements

1. Unified Project Structure
   - Single repository containing both frontend and backend code
   - Shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend
   - Common build and development scripts
   - No submodule architecture

2. Storage System
   - Generic key-value storage interface
   - Default implementation using file-system storage
   - Support for storing complex objects as values
   - Abstracted storage operations (get, set, delete, list)
   - Extensible design to support different storage backends in future

3. API Integration
   - Unified source of truth for API routes
   - Automatic generation of frontend API client from backend routes
   - Type-safe API contracts between frontend and backend
   - Centralized API documentation
   - Shared request/response type definitions

# Development Environment
- Vite-based development setup
- Hot module replacement for frontend
- Concurrent development server for backend
- Unified development commands (start, build, test)
- Shared environment configuration

```

client and server will have their own tsconfig.json files, their own build, dev, and start scripts. The shared folder will have its own tsconfig.json file, and will compile as a library.
 The common build, dev, and start scripts will call the build, client, and server scripts.

# Development Workflow
1. Define API routes in a shared specification
2. Implement backend routes in Express
3. Auto-generate frontend API clients
4. Implement frontend components using type-safe API clients
5. Use unified commands for development and building
